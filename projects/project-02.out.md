# Project 2: Suffix tree construction

You should implement a suffix tree construction algorithm. You can choose to implement the naive $O(n^2)$-time construction algorithm as discussed in class or McCreightâ€™s $O(n)$ construction algorithm. After that, implement a search algorithm (similar to slow-scan) for finding all occurrences of a pattern. This algorithm should run in $O(m+z)$ where $m$ is the length of the pattern and $z$ the number of occurrences.

Write a program, `st` using the suffix tree exact pattern search algorithm (similar to slow-scan) to report all indices in a string where a given pattern occurs.

The program should take the same options as in project 1: `st genome.fa reads.fq` and produce output in the same format. If you use any other options, describe them in the hand-in. The program should output (almost) the same SAM file. Because a search in a suffix tree is not done from the start to the end of the string the output might be in a different order, but if you sort the output from the previous project and for this program, they should be identical.

## Evaluation

Once you have implemented the `st` program (and tested it to the best of your abilities) fill out the report in the README file on GitHub, and notify me that your pull request is ready for review.

Further information is available on GitHub where you can choose between implementing the project in :
