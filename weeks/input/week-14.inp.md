# Week 14 â€” presentations of project 5

## Presentations of project 5

Each group will present their results obtained in project 5. We will also discuss what you learned from implementing your readmapper.

1. What was the most difficult issues
2. Were there issues (theoretical and practical) that we did not cover in the lectures that you would have liked us to?
3. If some sub-parts of the project should be moved to the weekly exercises, which should those be?
