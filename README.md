# Setup for moving schedule and slides to GitHub

Use this repo as a template for each time the class is taught. It contains the weekly plans, projects, and exercises. I put it on GitHub to get around limitations on the free Dropbox and the insane policy that we cannot share without login on OneDrive.

Each year, the GitHub organisation changes, and so do all the GitHub Classes exercise links, and this repo should also take care of updating those.
